# PE
The PE format is used by executables, object code, dynamic-link-libraries (DLLs), and binary files on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems. These notes accompany Ahmed Hesham's excellent guide [*A dive into the PE file format*](https://0xrick.github.io/win-internals/pe1/) into the Portable Executable (PE) file format. They document my process of learning about the PE format (and by doing so, trying to relearn some C++), by developing some simple software for parsing PE files as I progress through the guide. The intention is not to develop robust software to interrogate PE files: existing software is available that does this much better.
